# Visual Workflow Builder

**Visual Workflow Builder** is an interactive tool that allows users to create, modify, and execute workflows using an intuitive drag-and-drop interface. With the flexibility to design workflows through modular components, users can easily build complex systems by connecting various task nodes, making it a powerful tool for automating processes.

## Features

- **Drag-and-Drop Interface**: Easily create workflows by dragging and dropping task nodes onto a canvas. Arrange and connect them to define the sequence of operations.

- **Predefined Task Nodes**: Includes a variety of task nodes such as:
  - **Conditional Branching**: Add decision points in workflows to create different execution paths based on conditions.
  - **Data Validation**: Ensure the integrity and correctness of input data.
  - **Email Sending**: Automate email sending as part of the workflow.
  - **Large Language Model (LLM) Node**: Integrate AI-based tasks using LLMs to enhance workflow intelligence.
  - **File Downloading**: Trigger automated file downloads as part of the workflow.

- **Customizable Workflows**: Each node is configurable, allowing you to define inputs, outputs, and conditions for your specific use cases.

- **Workflow Execution**: Once designed, workflows can be executed directly within the platform, ensuring that tasks are performed in sequence as defined by the user.

- **Real-Time Updates**: The system dynamically updates the workflow status in real time, reflecting the execution progress and any potential errors.

- **Scalable Design**: Designed to be easily extendable. Developers can add new nodes or features to suit specific needs.

- **Visual Debugging**: Monitor the flow of data between nodes visually, allowing for easier troubleshooting and optimization.

- **Backend-Frontend Integration**: The backend handles the workflow processing, while the frontend provides a seamless user experience.

## Use Cases

- **Automated Data Pipelines**: Design workflows that validate, transform, and process data across multiple nodes, automating routine data processing tasks.
- **Email Automation**: Build workflows to automate email notifications based on various triggers and conditions.
- **AI-Powered Decisions**: Use the LLM node to incorporate machine learning models that make decisions or generate responses based on input data.
- **Custom Task Automation**: Combine multiple nodes to build custom automation workflows for any task involving file management, data processing, and more.

## How to Get Started
